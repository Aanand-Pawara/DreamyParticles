✨ Features

🎨 Shape Presets

Switch instantly between mathematically generated shapes:

Heart: Parametric heart curve.

Saturn: A rotating planet with icy rings (multi-colored).

Ring: A dense circular formation.

Star: A geometric star shape.

Spiral: A hypnotic mathematical spiral.

Flower: A polar rose curve.

🔤 Text-to-Particle Engine

Type any text to rasterize it into particles in real-time.

Supports dynamic resizing and distinct coloring.

🖱️ Physics & Interactions

Push (Repulse): Particles flee from the cursor.

Pull (Attract): Particles are drawn to the cursor like a black hole.

Swirl: Creates a vortex effect around the cursor.

Bomb: Click anywhere to trigger an explosive shockwave.

🛠️ Customization

Particle Count: Adjust from 100 to 8,000+ particles (performance dependent).

Fluidity: Control the ease and friction of particle movement.

Size & Radius: Modify particle size and interaction field strength.

🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites

All you need is a modern web browser. No Node.js or build steps required.

Installation

Clone the repository

git clone [https://github.com/AanandPawara/dreamy-particles.git](https://github.com/AanandPawara/dreamy-particles.git)


Open the project
Simply open particle_release.html (or index.html) in your browser.

Optional: For the best experience, run it using a local server (like Live Server in VS Code) to avoid any local file security restrictions with canvas data, though it generally works standalone.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 Canvas: For high-performance 2D rendering.

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+): Custom physics engine without external libraries.

CSS3: Glassmorphism UI design using backdrop-filter.
